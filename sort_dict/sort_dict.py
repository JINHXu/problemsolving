    Problem 5: String sorting.

   Course:      Data Structures and Algorithms for CL III - WS1920
   Assignment:  lab 1, exercise 5
   Author:      Jinghua Xu
   Description: Given a list of n strings of different lengths, 
   implement an algorithm to sort them in lexicographic order in O(d(n+N)) time, 
   where d is the maximum number of characters over all the n strings and N is the length of the letter alphabet over the n strings.
 
 Honor Code:  I pledge that this program represents my own work.

    <Your analysis should go here.>
